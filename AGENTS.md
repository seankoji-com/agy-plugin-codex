# Repository guidance

- This is a Node.js 18+ ESM Codex plugin. Keep behavior portable across macOS, Linux, and native Windows.
- Fix shared behavior at the earliest common boundary, usually in `scripts/lib/`; do not add caller-specific workarounds.
- When changing a skill or runtime contract, keep `skills/`, `internal-skills/`, `scripts/`, and the matching tests in sync.
- Run `npm run check` before merging.
- For releases, update `CHANGELOG.md` and keep `package.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` versions synchronized.
- Unit tests using plugin state must import `tests/support/isolate-codex-home.mjs` before state helpers so tests cannot write or migrate installed plugin data.
- Installer and hook child fixtures use `testHomeEnv` from `tests/support/test-home-env.mjs`; it sets a temporary Codex home and clears inherited plugin data overrides.
